## Getting Started
Simply clone the repository, then you can open the .sln file with Visual Studio. If you are using a different IDE, you will have to manually create the project files you require. Note that the included dependencies are only intended to be used with Visual Studio. If you aren't using Visual Studio, you'll need to download the correct version of SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, and SDL2_mixer for your IDE.

Once you have the project ready, you can compile the game. Before you run it, you will need to navigate to Dependencies/Dlls, copy all the contents of that directory, and paste it in the output directory. Again, these included DLL files are only intented to be used with Visual Studio. If you're not using Visual Studio or you're on a non-Windows OS, you'll need to get the correct dynamic library files you need (they are all bundled with the SDL2 libraries).

## How to Play
Move around with either A and D, or the arrow keys. You can attack using Space or F. To use the special attack, hold S when attacking. Try to get the highest score you can!
